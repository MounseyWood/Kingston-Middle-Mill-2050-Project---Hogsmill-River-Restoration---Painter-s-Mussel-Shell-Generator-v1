## Hogsmill River Restoration: Painter's Mussel Shell Pattern Generator

### üêö **Project Overview**

An interactive educational simulation that visualizes how Painter's Mussel (*Unio pictorum*) shells could record 25 years of environmental history during the Hogsmill River restoration (2025-2050). This scientifically accurate pattern generator demonstrates the relationship between water quality, pollution levels, and biological responses in one of only 200 rare chalk streams worldwide.

### üéØ **Educational Purpose**

Designed as a conversation starter for Kingston School of Art students interested in creative data visualisation. This has been 'vibe-coded' with Claude.AI. I've also used Perplexity and ChatGPT to gather initial research on Painter's Mussels and algorthmic generative patterns for biomimicry.

## üìö **Scientific Foundation**

### **Research Sources**
- [Freshwater Mussel Shells Reveal Environmental Change](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.17532) - 3,300 years of hydrological records
- [Clumped Isotopes Reveal Growth-Discharge Relationships](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11369190/) - Growth band validation studies  
- [Global Freshwater Mussel Conservation](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10100069/) - Emerging threats and opportunities

### **Key Research Findings Implemented**
- Microplastics reduce growth rates by 35.6%
- Temperature is primary driver of seasonal band formation
- Heavy metals create distinctive shell mineralization patterns
- 95% decline in Thames tributary mussel populations since 1960s

### **Conservation Context**
- **WET Hogsmill Project** (2023-2025): ¬£393,000 restoration investment
- **Fish Passage Restoration**: 18 of 19 historic weirs now passable
- **Species Recovery**: Water vole reintroduction, European eel habitat creation
- **Long-term Vision**: Self-sustaining mussel populations by 2050
